## Security.txt


For websites, the security.txt file should be placed under the `/.well-known/` path (`/.well-known/security.txt`) [RFC8615](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615).  

It can also be placed in the root directory (`/security.txt`) of a website, especially if the `/.well-known/` directory cannot be used for technical reasons, or simply as a fallback. 

The file can be placed in both locations of a website at the same time.

## DNS Security.txt
   
   

Just as security.txt can be deployed into either the root or the `.well-known` directory of a webserver, DNS Security TXT can be deployed to either the apex of a domain, or under a specially created _security.domain.com subdomain. This approach allows organizations to decide the approach that suits them best.

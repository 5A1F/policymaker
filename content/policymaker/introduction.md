# Welcome to the Policymaker!

> This site is currently in Beta. Please post comments/feedback/suggestions [here](https://community.disclose.io/t/policymaker-is-live-in-beta/255).

## Who is this for?


*Policymaker is a "one-stop-shop" policy tool for anyone who is implementing a vulnerability disclosure program (VDP) for the first time, or who already has a VDP and would like to add:*

- Safe harbour standards,
- A security.txt file, and
- DNS Security TXT records.

## What does it do?

1. Policymaker will ask you a few questions about your organization name, security contact channels, preferred policy deployment page, and vulnerability disclosure timeline if you have one.
2. The tool will pull from the [disclose.io](https://disclose.io) standardized policy repository (which has been created and is maintained by industry experts, lawyers, and legal teams of large organizations that run a VDP), and customize a policy just for you.
3. You'll be able to download the policy in HTML or Markdown, as well as an RFC-compliant security.txt and DNS Security TXT records.
4. From there, you can take the policy and the records and implement them, modify them as needed, or pass them along to your security and legal teams for review.

## What comes next?

This is the important part... We've worked hard to make the creation of these artifacts as easy and standardized as possible, but the power kicks in when they are implemented.

1. The VDP is published on a web page on your main website or used with a VDP platform provider like Bugcrowd, HackerOne, or Inrigriti, the security.txt file is placed in a directory on the servers and systems covered by the VDP, and the DNS Security TXT records are inserted into the DNS zone for domains covered by the VDP.
2. ...If you are confused by this, don't worry - Instructions are provided with each artifact, and you can pass them along to the appropriate teams within your organization to implement.
3. Your domain will be added to a list of domains scanned for update into the [Disclose.io](https://disclose.io) Contact Database, and once the security.txt is implemented your new VDP will appear in our records.
4. Once your published policy is reviewed, your VDP will be marked as "Level 4 - Full Safe Harbor" or "Level 5 - Full Safe Harbor with CVD" in the [Disclose.io](https://disclose.io) Status Database, and you'll be able to display the appropriate Disclose.io Maturity Seal on your website.

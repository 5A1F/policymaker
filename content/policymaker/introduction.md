> This site is currently in Beta. Please post comments/feedback/suggestions [here](https://community.disclose.io/t/policymaker-is-live-in-beta/255) or in #2-policymaker if you are in the [disclose.io](http://disclose.io) Slack.

## **Who is this for?**

*Policymaker is a "one-stop-shop" policy generator for anyone who is implementing a vulnerability disclosure program (VDP) for the first time, or who already has a VDP and would like to add:*

- Safe harbour standards,
- A security.txt file, and
- DNS Security TXT records.

## **What does it do?**

1. Policymaker will ask you a few questions about your organization name, security contact channels, preferred policy deployment page, and vulnerability disclosure timeline if you have one.
2. The tool will pull from the [disclose.io](https://disclose.io/) standardized policy repository (which has been created and is maintained by industry experts, lawyers, and legal teams of large organizations that run a VDP), and customize a policy just for you.
3. You'll be able to download the policy in HTML or Markdown, as well as an RFC-compliant security.txt and DNS Security TXT records.
4. From there, you can take the policy and the records and implement them, or pass them along to your security and legal teams for review.

## What will I need?

- Your organization's legal name.
- The contact channels where you plan to receive security reports. Web forms, and email addresses, or a combination of both is acceptable.
- The address where you plan to host your VDP policy. Note: You can change this later if you need to.
- (Optional): A coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) timeframe. If you don't know what this is, you'll be provided with a sane default and given the option to opt-out.

## **What comes next?**

This is the important part... We've worked hard to make the creation of these artifacts easy and standardized, but **the power kicks in when you implement them!**

1. Publish your VDP on a web page on your main website, or with a VDP platform provider like Bugcrowd, HackerOne, or Intigriti, deploy the security.txt file in a directory on the servers and systems covered by the VDP, and publish the DNS Security TXT records into the DNS zone for domains covered by the VDP.
2. Instructions are provided with each artifact, and you can pass them along to the appropriate teams within your organization to implement.
3. Your domain will be added to a list of domains scanned for update into the [Disclose.io](https://disclose.io/) Contact Database, and once the security.txt is implemented your new VDP will appear in our records.
4. Once your published policy is reviewed, your VDP will be marked as **Level 4 - Full Safe Harbor** or **Level 5 - Full Safe Harbor with CVD** in the [Disclose.io](https://disclose.io/) Status Database, and you'll be able to display the appropriate Disclose.io Maturity Seal on your website.
